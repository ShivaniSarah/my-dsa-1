A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes(i.e. 
All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.

Multiple spanning trees can be formed for given N nodes meaning multiple combinations of N-1 edges can be formed giving rise to a new tree.
we have to find the spanning tree with minimum sum of weights which is called minimum spanning tree.

class Pair {
    int node;
    int distance;
    public Pair(int distance, int node) {
        this.node = node;
        this.distance = distance;
    }
}

class Solution {
    static int spanningTree(int V, int E, List<List<int[]>> adj) {
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<Pair>((x, y) -> x.distance - y.distance);
        int[] vis = new int[V];
        pq.add(new Pair(0, 0));
        int sum = 0;

        while (pq.size() > 0) {
            int wt = pq.peek().distance;
            int node = pq.peek().node;
            pq.remove();

            if (vis[node] == 1) continue;

            vis[node] = 1;
            sum += wt;

            for (int[] edge : adj.get(node)) {
                int adjNode = edge[0];
                int edW = edge[1];
                if (vis[adjNode] == 0) {
                    pq.add(new Pair(edW, adjNode));
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
